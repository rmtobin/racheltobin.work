## Description  
This was a complete redesign project that added a variety of new features from the original Stenciltown site.
We added user accounts, social features such as "likes" and user profiles, integration with our new single sign on OAuth 2.0 provider, Omni ID, as well as new API endpoints to allow users to upload stencils directly from within the OmniGraffle app.

## Tools Used  
- SCSS
- Partial Backbone Front-end(previous iteration was 100% Backbone front end)
- jQuery
- OAuth 2
- Python/Django
- Postgresql
- ImageMagick
