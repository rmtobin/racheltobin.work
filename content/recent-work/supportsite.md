## Description
For this project, we wanted to add a knowledge-base like functionality to our previously static-only, FAQ-style product support pages, as well as provide a single location for users to access our manuals on the web. In collaboration with another web developer, we devised a system where support staff could write support articles using Markdown and add them easily to the support site without needing to enlist developer help. In addition to this, we leveraged the Python Whoosh library to make these articles searchable with a search-as-you-type feature. For documentation, we created scripts to read the EPUB documents our documentation team was already producing, and convert them to indexable, web-based documentation.

## Tools Used
- Python
