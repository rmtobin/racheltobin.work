## Description
In this project, I was tasked with creating an interactive element on our OmniFocus marketing page showcasing the new Apple Watch App. This was prior to the Apple Watch release, so no actual Apple Watches were yet available. Given the simplicity of the watch interface, I decided to do a full demo of our watch app, as if the user were using the real app. In collaboration with a designer, we created all UI elements of the watch app in SVG using Illustrator, and used JavaScript to trigger page changes, simulating the actual app. This was then paired with description tex timed with the page changes.

## Tools Used
- JavaScript and jQuery
- SVG
- Adobe Illustrator
- SCSS
